NetSpeeddataCollector
=====================

A quick and dirty C# application I wrote up to store the Average and Maximum download speed every five minutes into a MySQL Database that can be later extracted and analysed.


Working application, configuration is hard-coded to my Database as of now, can be changed by changing the code.
